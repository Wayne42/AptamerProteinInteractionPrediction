# AptamerProteinInteractionPrediction

PyTorch project to predict interaction of aptamers and proteins

Created and tested with Python 3.9.2

Note: This is just a sample project skeleton as of right now.
There are not enough data sets out there to create a working model - as far as I know for now. :(


# install:

First make sure you use Python 3.9.2.
Then, in the project directory, run: 

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
